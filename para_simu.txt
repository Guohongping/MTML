 ### MTML: An efficient multi-trait multi-locus GWAS method based on Cauchy combination test
 #' three Steps of multi-trait multi-locus GWAS method (MTML)
 #' step1 (single-trait): matrix transformation for single-trait decomposition analyses
 #' step2 (multi-locus): dimension reduction and deshrinking ridge regression for multi-locus analyses
 #' step3 (multi-trait): cauchy combination test for aggregating the individual p-values of multiple traits
 
 @param kk is the initial kinship matrix
 @param psmatrix is the initial P-value
 @param Likelihood is the likelihood function type, "REML" represents restrictive maximum likelihood; "ML" represents maximum likelihood
 @param svpal is the P-value threshold for significance in first step.
 @param Genformat is the gene mode (including 0 and 1)
 @param CLO is the the number of computer cores
 @param snp is the number of genotypes
 @param spvalue is the P-value threshold for significance in third step.
