MTML: An efficient multi-trait multi-locus GWAS method based on Cauchy combination test.

#' @param kk is the genomic relationship matrix.
#' @param psmatrix is the initial P-value.
#' @param Likelihood is the likelihood function type, "REML" represents restrictive maximum likelihood; "ML" represents maximum likelihood.
#' @param svpal is the P-value threshold for significance in the single trait part.
#' @param Genformat is the gene mode, including 0 and 1.
#' @param CLO is the number of computer cores.
#' @param trait_k is the insterest traits in GWAS, trait_k = d = (2,5,10).
#' @param snp is the markers being tested.
#' @param N represents execution/loop count, N = (500,200,100).
#' @param spvalue is the P-value threshold for significance in the multiple traits part.

Data set used: three Arabidopsis thaliana flowering-time related traits, which is publicly available at http://www.arabidopsis.usc.edu

We also uploaded the data to Github, see https://github.com/Guohongping/MTML/tree/main/real_data

File list: 
MTML.R: The main function that performs our MTML algorithm
cauchyComb.R: Perform the cauchy combination test for aggregating the individual p-values of multiple traits
ridge.R: The function for deshrinking ridge regression for multi-locus analyses
simulate.R: Simulates the phenotype datasets for three simulation scenarios. Notice that the simulated SNPs' genotypes are extracted from real dataset and four QTNs are supposed.
single_trait.R: Perform the GWAS method of single trait
statistic.R: Provide the type I error ratio, average statistical power, and statistical powers of the four QTNs in three simulation scenarios

Folder list:
methods_comparison_real: Real data analyses using the four methods (MTML, GEMMA, FASTmrEMMA and mvLMM) 
methods_comparison_simu: Calculate the performance measurements which are generated by statistic.R for the four methods (MTML, GEMMA, FASTmrEMMA and mvLMM) in simulations 
plink: Convert the genotype and phenotype datasets into PLINK format, i.e., .ped and .map files, which are required in GEMMA and mvLMM analyses 
real_data: The SNPs' genotype dataset and phenotype dataset for three Arabidopsis thaliana flowering-time related traits
simu_data: The simulated SNPs' genotype datatset, four QTNs' genotype datatset, and simulated phenotype datasets which are generated by simulate.R when trait number equals to 2, 5, 10 in three simulation scenarios
